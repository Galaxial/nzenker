UX Schemas, Web Design, and functional front-end and back-end Development
Among the following are design concepts for a conceptual college website serving multiple utility purposes. The graphic design elements are discussed from concept, through wireframe, through final mockups and design specifications.

This report discusses the proposal for a graphic design postsecondary institution to be established at Elliot Lake, Ontario, and explores aspects of said proposal specifically in regards to developing a website for it. It does so through researching the region's history, geography, culture, and external influences. This research, in addition to research on the primary specialty field the proposed college in question brings priority to (Graphic Design), is then used to integrate said aspects into the design behind the website. It explores used and unused potential influences for both the aesthetic & functional design behind the website, and uses said influences to translate them into a usable design. 

	Influences and design criteria established from the research portions were then created into a collection of usable elements, such as a colour palette for use during its creation and a collection of well-contrasting typefaces. 

	Content is then created, and several wireframe rough drafts to simulate these effects. Furthermore, successes and failures were accounted for to create digitally refined wireframe mockups of several key pages of the proposed website as a template to work from. 

	Finally, when refined wireframe templates had been created, mockups of said pages were developed within Adobe Illustrator, following design patterns with slight improvements implemented through development. Graphics were designed and created with Adobe Photoshop, and when required, photographic graphic elements were created using free domain stock images.
